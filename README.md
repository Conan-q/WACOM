# DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEM MODULE TO MEASURE THE VARIATION IN MICROGRAPHIA AND SPEECH FOR PARKINSON’S DISEASE


## 1.1 ABSTRACT

Parkinson’s Disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegeneration disorders, have symptoms visible in most motor activities like movement (tremor, rigidity, micrographia) and speech (imprecise articulation and rhythm, stuttering). The speed and pressure data from a person handwriting stroke can have many applications in medical and psychological analysis. Moreover, a person’s speech data can be used to track progression of PD based on its symptoms on vocal system using Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). These data, gathered from the patient, can be subjected to various mathematical analysis to track progression of PD. *We aim to make this data collection seamless by designing a novel user-friendly proprietary software to record and analyse the handwriting/speech data in real time for identifying the progression/severity of PD.*
