# PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT TO EXTRACT  FEATURES FROM PEN TABLETS

The aim is to extract data from a person's digital handwriting  from a *commercial pen tablet*. The collected data will be processed and formed into datasets for analysis via different algorithms.
### 1.1 AIM
To design a software prototype which will monitor the various parameters associated with handwriting data. This project’s purpose is to create a windowsbased software capable of capturing handwriting data through capable hardware.
The software shall be proprietary and will work with a pen-digitizer hardware setup of the manufacturer: [“WACOM”](https://www.wacom.com/). The recorded data shall be stored locally on the system running the software. This recorded data sets to be in CSV and text formats. The point of this work was to set up a dependable PC based winding portraying technique for evaluation of the seriousness of the malady. This examination has
researched the elements of portraying a winding to recognize solid subjects and PD patients with various dimensions of seriousness and proposes another component
with more grounded relationship with the seriousness of the illness.

### 1.2  OBJECTIVES
1. To create a windows compatible application to work with [WIN32 API](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/API/Win32) and [WINTAB](https://developer-docs.wacom.com/display/DevDocs/Developer+Documentation) drivers.
2. To create a software DAQ to accumulate various captured data to locally stored
files

### 1.3  WORKING MODEL  
1. The total occurrences of “pen up-down”, i.e, change in coordinate data when pressure data is nil.  
2. The UI of the app will consist of a launcher window containing recording session screen.  
3. The main UI will consist of the pen ink visualization, based on the pen data.  
4. The recorded data will be exported as CSV files for further analysis.  
5. A preliminary report consisting of scalar data will be exported in TXT format
